## Recommended Mitigations
1. **Input Validation**: Sanitize and validate all user inputs.  
2. **Prepared Statements**: Use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection.  
3. **Output Encoding**: Encode data before rendering it in the application.  
4. **Content Security Policy (CSP)**: Implement CSP to mitigate HTML injection risks.
