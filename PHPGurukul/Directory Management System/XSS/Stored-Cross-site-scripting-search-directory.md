# Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Vulnerability in PHPGurukul Directory Management System v2.0

## Vulnerability Summary
A critical **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)** vulnerability was discovered in the `/DMS/dms/admin/search-directory.php` file of PHPGurukul's Directory Management System (v2.0). Attackers can inject malicious scripts via the `searchdata` POST parameter, which are then persistently stored and executed when the search functionality is used.

## Proof of Concept (PoC)

### Step-by-Step Exploitation
1. **Admin Panel Login**  
   - Authenticate to the admin portal using valid credentials.

2. **Navigate to Search Directory**  
   - Access the "Search Directory" section from the dashboard.

3. **Intercept Search Request**  
   - Configure Burp Suite (`127.0.0.1:8080`) to intercept the POST request.  
   - Enable the **Interceptor** in Burp's Proxy tab.

4. **Inject Malicious Payload**  
   - Capture the request and modify the `searchdata` parameter with:  
     ```html
     <script>alert(1)</script>
     ```

5. **Execute and Observe**  
   - The injected script renders persistently, triggering an alert when the search page is reloaded.

## Potential Impact
- **Session Hijacking**: Steal admin cookies or session tokens.  
- **Phishing Attacks**: Inject fake login forms to harvest credentials.  
- **Defacement**: Modify displayed content to spread misinformation.  
- **Malware Distribution**: Redirect users to malicious sites.

## Mitigation Strategies
1. **Input Sanitization**  
   - Use libraries like `htmlspecialchars()` or DOMPurify to neutralize HTML/JS in user inputs.  
2. **Content Security Policy (CSP)**  
   - Implement CSP headers to restrict inline scripts and unauthorized sources.  
3. **Output Encoding**  
   - Encode dynamic content before rendering (e.g., via OWASPâ€™s ESAPI).  
4. **Framework Protections**  
   - Leverage modern PHP frameworks (e.g., Laravel, Symfony) with built-in XSS protections.
